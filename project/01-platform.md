A Schottky resonator is a non-perturbing beam diagnostic instrumnet in a storage ring.
The experimential platform of the Schottky resonator at CSRe has been established since 2016.
The goal for our platform is to conduct experiments for the nuclear mass and half-life measurement.

In the beamtime of the previous years, we have tested and updated the DAQ system and the data monitor.
Now, the platform of the resonator is in good operation.
After the optimization of our CSRe, the specific experiments will be on the agenda.

The programs are as follows.
* [Data acquisition]({{ "/project/platform/data-acquisition" | relative_url }}): two versions of the control interface (<a href="{{ '/project/platform/data-acquisition/#CLI' | relative_url }}" target="_blank">CLI</a> & <a href="{{ '/project/platform/data-acquisition/#GUI' | relative_url }}" target="_blank">GUI</a>) for the data acquisition of the Schottky resonator at CSRe (Since 2016 until now)
* [Data monitor]({{ "/project/platform/data-monitor" | relative_url }}): the real-time monitor for the acquired Schottky data (Since 2017 until now)
