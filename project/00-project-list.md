## Have a look on our projects!

Our group is devoted to conduct experiments of nuclear mass and half-life measurement on the Schottky resonator at Experimental Cooler Storage Ring (CSRe). 
The whole projects focus on two topic. One is for the platform setup, the other is for the useful tools used in experiments.

The projects are as follows.
* [Platform deploy]({{ "/project/platform/" | relative_url }})
    - [Data acquisition]({{ "/project/platform/data-acquisition/" | relative_url }}): a control program for the data acquisition system of the Schottky resonator at CSRe
    - [Data monitor]({{ "/project/platform/data-monitor" | relative_url }}): an online monitor to real-time display the collected Schottky data
* [Tools]({{ "/project/tools/" | relative_url }})
    - [Ring experiment toolkit]({{ "/project/tools/ring-exp-toolkit" | relative_url }}): a collection of tools for heavy-ion experiments at storage rings
    - [Schottky data analysis]({{ "/project/tools/data-analysis" | relative_url }}): a library of analysis tools for Schottky data
